# GitHub Projects Story Points

Forked from https://github.com/brthrs/github-project-story-points.

A Chrome Extension to add [story points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) totals to [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/articles/about-projects/) columns.

You can estimate issues by adding a suffix like `(11pts)` or `(11Â±3pts)`. The number will be converted into a tag at the top of the project column.

This extension will also show the number of unestimated issues in a project.
